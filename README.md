# Space-Sandbox #
Initially was a tech demo to show the simplicity of SFML, however I am now taking it up to make it a game with some depth.

## Plans ##
* Refactor the existing code base using knowledge I've picked up since I've last worked on the project.
  * Improve Information Hiding.
  * Make methods more clear, add more comments, get rid of magic numbers.
  * Improve performance.
* Add in Planet Surfaces
* Implement random pirate attacks.
